# Untangled â€¢ [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com)

A client-only standard todomvc is on the `client-only` branch of this
git repository. This branch contains a full-stack implementation of 
the TodoMVC application, with the following extensions:

- Lists are persisted on the server (currently selected by adding a ?list=X param to URL)
- Internationalization (coming soon)
- Support VCR Viewer (coming soon)

## Configure it:

Copy `resources/config/defaults.edn` to `/usr/local/etc/todomvc.edn`.

```
{                                                                                                                          
 :datomic {:dbs {:todo {:url          "datomic:mem://todo"                                                                 
                        :schema       "todomvc.migrations"                                                                 
                        :auto-migrate true                                                                                 
                        :auto-drop    true                                                                                 
                        }}}                                                                                                
 :port    3000}      
```

You can configure the datomic database URL to a file-based one if you 
wish, in which case you might want to turn off `auto-drop` so
your lists persist over server restarts. Leave
`auto-migrate` on, since that just makes sure the schema is up-to-date.

## Running it:

Start figwheel (the JVM options tell figwheel which builds to run):

```
JVM_OPTS="-Ddev -Dtest" lein run -m clojure.main script/figwheel.clj
```

which should start auto-building the cljs source and show a browser REPL.

Start a CLJ REPL:

```
lein repl
```

At the REPL, start the server:

```
(go)
```

Navigate to: [http://localhost:3000/dev.html?list=MyList](http://localhost:3000/dev.html?list=MyList)

The list URL parameter allows you to select which persisted TODO list on the server
you want.

Changes to the source should re-render without a browser reload. 

Changes to server code can be put into effect at the REPL (will wipe database) with:

```
(reset)
```

## Running the tests

The figwheel build above will start the client test build. Simply open
(any number of) browsers on 
[http://localhost:3000/test.html](http://localhost:3000/test.html)
